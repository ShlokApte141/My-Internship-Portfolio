# 🚖 Uber Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to ride-hailing services. The study focuses on factors such as trip distribution, peak hours, popular pickup/dropoff locations, and other key metrics.

## 📊 Features and Analysis
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming raw Uber trip data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends in ride frequency, time-based variations, and location hotspots.
- **Visualization:** Generating insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping Uber pickup and dropoff locations.
- **Peak Hour Analysis:** Finding the busiest times for Uber rides.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (Numerical operations)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For interactive data analysis)
- **Geopandas/Folium (Optional)** (For geospatial visualization)

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains information on Uber trips, including:
  - `Date/Time`: Timestamp of the trip
  - `Lat, Lon`: Pickup latitude and longitude
  - `Base`: Code associated with the Uber base station
