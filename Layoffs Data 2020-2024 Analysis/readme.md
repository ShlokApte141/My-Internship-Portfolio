# 📊 Layoff Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global layoff data to identify trends in layoffs across industries, companies, and time periods. The dataset is cleaned, explored, and visualized using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

Key insights include:
- Companies with the highest layoffs.
- Industries most affected by layoffs.
- Monthly trends in layoffs.
- Correlation between funding and layoffs.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Interactive Visualizations  
✅ Correlation Heatmap  
✅ Industry-wise and Company-wise Analysis
