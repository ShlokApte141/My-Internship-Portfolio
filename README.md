📓 My Internship Portfolio

Welcome to my **Internship Portfolio**! This repository documents my journey as a **Data Analyst Intern**, showcasing various projects involving **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning**. Each project is structured with datasets, analysis, insights, and visualizations.

---

## 🔰 Introduction
During my internship, I worked on **real-world datasets** to derive meaningful insights, improve decision-making processes, and build data-driven solutions. This repository serves as a **journal of my projects**, demonstrating my expertise in **Python, SQL, Tableau, and machine learning**.  

Through these projects, I have honed my skills in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data visualization, predictive modeling, and reporting**. This portfolio is a testament to my learning, challenges, and accomplishments throughout my internship.
